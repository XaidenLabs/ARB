Africa Research Base is an AI-powered data repository with blockchain attribution that enables researchers across African institutions to upload datasets, gain recognition for their contributions, and discover relevant research from across the continent.

## The Problem

Valuable research data from African universities disappears when projects end. Students graduate, datasets vanish, and future researchers start from scratch. This creates a cycle of duplicated effort and lost knowledge that hinders scientific progress across the continent.

## Our Solution

A blockchain-based research data platform that preserves institutional knowledge, ensures transparent attribution, and builds verifiable research reputation. Every dataset uploaded becomes a permanent, discoverable resource with immutable attribution records.
